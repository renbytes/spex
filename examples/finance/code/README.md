## Getting Started

### 1. Set up the conda environment

```bash
# Create and activate conda environment with Java&#x2F;Spark
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pyspark-analysis-env

# Install project in development mode
make install-dev
```

### 2. Run the analysis

```bash
# Run the main analysis
make run

# Generate the HTML report
make report

# Or directly with python
python job.py
```

### 3. Development tools

```bash
# Start the interactive dashboard
make dashboard

# Start Jupyter Lab
make notebook

# Run tests
make test
```


## Modern Python Features

This project uses modern Python development practices:

- **📦 pyproject.toml**: Modern Python project configuration
- **🐍 conda environments**: Reproducible data science environments  
- **🧪 pytest**: Comprehensive testing framework
- **🎨 black**: Automatic code formatting
- **🔍 mypy**: Static type checking
- **🪝 pre-commit**: Git hooks for code quality
- **📓 Jupyter**: Interactive development and exploration

## Data Sources

- **stock_prices**: Historical daily price data for Bitcoin (BTC).


## Metrics Calculated

- **moving_average**: Calculate a 90-day moving average of the closing price. Plot this on the same chart as the raw daily closing price for comparison.
- **forecasted_price**: Using a SARIMA model, forecast the daily closing price 1 year into the future. The final output should include the 95% confidence interval bands.


## Development Workflow

```bash
# Format and lint code
make format lint

# Run tests
make test

# Quick development checks
make quick-test

# Clean up generated files
make clean
```

## Next Steps

1. **📁 Add your data**: Place data files in `data/raw/`
2. **⚙️ Configure**: Update paths in configuration files if needed
3. **🏃 Run analysis**: Execute `make run` to generate insights
4. **📊 Check results**: Review outputs in `outputs/` directory
5. **🎨 Customize**: Modify visualizations and reports as needed
6. **🧪 Test**: Add your own tests in the `tests/` directory

## Troubleshooting

- **Environment issues**: Try `make clean-all && make setup`
- **Missing dependencies**: Run `make update-deps`
- **Test failures**: Check `make status` for environment info
